In this folder you will find the code used for the non-linear models to estimate inbreeding depression in growth rates using brms. 

File 3.1_ID_growth_bill.R has been annotated in detail for reproducibility but annotations apply to all scripts.

3.1* is for bill length
3.2* is for body mass
3.3* is for tarsus length 

When specified 3.*_FROH.R shows when the ROH based inbreeding coefficient is being used, otherwise the allele sharing inbreeding coefficient is used (FuniW)
