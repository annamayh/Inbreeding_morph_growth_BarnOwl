0) Set up - making dataframes using the datasets from the long term study system, calculating inbreeding coefficients, estimating population level growth parameters
1) Linear mixed models
2) Heritability estimates
3) Non-linear models - estimating inbreeding depression in growth
4) Genetic architecture of inbreeding depression
