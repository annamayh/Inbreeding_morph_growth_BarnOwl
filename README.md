# Supporting code for Inbreeding depression in barn owls

Code is broadly split into 5 categories, with more detailed info within each folder:

0) Set up - making dataframes using the datasets from the long term study system, calculating inbreeding coefficients, estimating population level growth parameters
1) Linear mixed models
2) Heritability estimates
3) Non-linear models - estimating inbreeding depression in growth
4) Genetic architecture of inbreeding depression

Dataframes etc. used for analyses in 1-4 can be found on my FigShare: 10.6084/m9.figshare.31241764 ; 10.6084/m9.figshare.31241983 ; 10.6084/m9.figshare.31242073

*Note*:  If you plan to use any of these datasets for analysis/publications or have any questions please contact me (annahewett28@gmail.com). This data is part of a long term study that many collaborators have collected - they also have extensive knowledge of the species so would be happy to hear your ideas.
